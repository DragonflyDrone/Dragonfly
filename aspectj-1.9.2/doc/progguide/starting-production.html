        This section presents examples of aspects that are inherently
        intended to be included in the production builds of an application.
        Production aspects tend to add functionality to an application
        rather than merely adding more visibility of the internals of a
        program. Again, we begin with name-based aspects and follow with
        property-based aspects.  Name-based production aspects tend to
        affect only a small number of methods. For this reason, they are a
        good next step for projects adopting AspectJ. But even though they
        tend to be small and simple, they can often have a significant
        effect in terms of making the program easier to understand and
        maintain.
      </p><div class="sect2"><a name="change-monitoring"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="change-monitoring"></a>Change Monitoring</h3></div></div><p>
        The first example production aspect shows how one might implement
        some simple functionality where it is problematic to try and do it
        explicitly. It supports the code that refreshes the display. The
        role of the aspect is to maintain a dirty bit indicating whether or
        not an object has moved since the last time the display was
        refreshed.
      </p><p>
        Implementing this functionality as an aspect is straightforward.
        The <tt>testAndClear</tt> method is called by the
        display code to find out whether a figure element has moved
        recently. This method returns the current state of the dirty flag
        and resets it to false. The pointcut <tt>move</tt>
        captures all the method calls that can move a figure element. The
        after advice on <tt>move</tt> sets the dirty flag
        whenever an object moves.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect MoveTracking {
    private static boolean dirty = false;

    public static boolean testAndClear() {
        boolean result = dirty;
        dirty = false;
        return result;
    }

    pointcut move():
        call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int)) ||
        call(void Line.setP1(Point))             ||
        call(void Line.setP2(Point))             ||
        call(void Point.setX(int))               ||
        call(void Point.setY(int));

    after() returning: move() {
        dirty = true;
    }
}
</pre><p>
        Even this simple example serves to illustrate some of the important
        benefits of using AspectJ in production code. Consider implementing
        this functionality with ordinary Java: there would likely be a
        helper class that contained the <tt>dirty</tt> flag, the
        <tt>testAndClear</tt> method, as well as a
        <tt>setFlag</tt> method. Each of the methods that could
        move a figure element would include a call to the
        <tt>setFlag</tt> method. Those calls, or rather the
        concept that those calls should happen at each move operation, are
        the crosscutting concern in this case.
      </p><p>
        The AspectJ implementation has several advantages over the standard
        implementation:
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>The structure of the crosscutting concern is captured
        explicitly.</i></span> The moves pointcut clearly states all the
        methods involved, so the programmer reading the code sees not just
        individual calls to <tt>setFlag</tt>, but instead sees
        the real structure of the code. The IDE support included with
        AspectJ automatically reminds the programmer that this aspect
        advises each of the methods involved.  The IDE support also
        provides commands to jump to the advice from the method and
        vice-versa.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>Evolution is easier.</i></span> If, for example, the
        aspect needs to be revised to record not just that some figure
        element moved, but rather to record exactly which figure elements
        moved, the change would be entirely local to the aspect. The
        pointcut would be updated to expose the object being moved, and the
        advice would be updated to record that object. The paper
        <i>An Overview of AspectJ</i> (available linked off
        of the AspectJ web site -- <a href="http://eclipse.org/aspectj" target="_top">http://eclipse.org/aspectj</a>), presented at ECOOP
        2001, presents a detailed discussion of various ways this aspect
        could be expected to evolve.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>The functionality is easy to plug in and out.</i></span>
        Just as with development aspects, production aspects may need to be
        removed from the system, either because the functionality is no
        longer needed at all, or because it is not needed in certain
        configurations of a system. Because the functionality is
        modularized in a single aspect this is easy to do.
      </p><p>
        <span class="emphasis"><i>The implementation is more stable.</i></span> If, for
        example, the programmer adds a subclass of
        <tt>Line</tt> that overrides the existing methods,
        this advice in this aspect will still apply. In the ordinary Java
        implementation the programmer would have to remember to add the
        call to <tt>setFlag</tt> in the new overriding
        method. This benefit is often even more compelling for
        property-based aspects (see the section <a href="starting-production.html#starting-production-consistentBehavior">Providing Consistent Behavior</a>).
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="context-passing"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="context-passing"></a>Context Passing</h3></div></div><p>
        The crosscutting structure of context passing can be a significant
        source of complexity in Java programs. Consider implementing
        functionality that would allow a client of the figure editor (a
        program client rather than a human) to set the color of any figure
        elements that are created. Typically this requires passing a color,
        or a color factory, from the client, down through the calls that
        lead to the figure element factory. All programmers are familiar
        with the inconvenience of adding a first argument to a number of
        methods just to pass this kind of context information.
      </p><p>
        Using AspectJ, this kind of context passing can be implemented in a
        modular way. The following code adds after advice that runs only
        when the factory methods of <tt>Figure</tt> are
        called in the control flow of a method on a
        <tt>ColorControllingClient</tt>.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect ColorControl {
    pointcut CCClientCflow(ColorControllingClient client):
        cflow(call(* * (..)) &amp;&amp; target(client));

    pointcut make(): call(FigureElement Figure.make*(..));

    after (ColorControllingClient c) returning (FigureElement fe):
            make() &amp;&amp; CCClientCflow(c) {
        fe.setColor(c.colorFor(fe));
    }
}
</pre><p>
        This aspect affects only a small number of methods, but note that
        the non-AOP implementation of this functionality might require
        editing many more methods, specifically, all the methods in the
        control flow from the client to the factory. This is a benefit
        common to many property-based aspects while the aspect is short and
        affects only a modest number of benefits, the complexity the aspect
        saves is potentially much larger.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="starting-production-consistentBehavior"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="starting-production-consistentBehavior"></a>Providing Consistent Behavior</h3></div></div><p>
        This example shows how a property-based aspect can be used to
        provide consistent handling of functionality across a large set of
        operations. This aspect ensures that all public methods of the
        <tt>com.bigboxco</tt> package log any Errors they throw
        to their caller (in Java, an Error is like an Exception, but it
        indicates that something really bad and usually unrecoverable has
        happened).  The <tt>publicMethodCall</tt> pointcut
        captures the public method calls of the package, and the after
        advice runs whenever one of those calls throws an Error. The advice
        logs that Error and then the throw resumes.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PublicErrorLogging {
    Log log = new Log();

    pointcut publicMethodCall():
        call(public * com.bigboxco.*.*(..));

    after() throwing (Error e): publicMethodCall() {
        log.write(e);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        In some cases this aspect can log an exception twice. This happens
        if code inside the <tt>com.bigboxco</tt> package itself
        calls a public method of the package. In that case this code will
        log the error at both the outermost call into the
        <tt>com.bigboxco</tt> package and the re-entrant
        call. The <tt>cflow</tt> primitive pointcut can be used
        in a nice way to exclude these re-entrant calls:</p><pre class="programlisting">
after() throwing (Error e):
        publicMethodCall() &amp;&amp; !cflow(publicMethodCall()) {
    log.write(e);
}
</pre><p>
        The following aspect is taken from work on the AspectJ compiler.
        The aspect advises about 35 methods in the
        <tt>JavaParser</tt> class. The individual methods
        handle each of the different kinds of elements that must be
        parsed. They have names like <tt>parseMethodDec</tt>,
        <tt>parseThrows</tt>, and
        <tt>parseExpr</tt>.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect ContextFilling {
    pointcut parse(JavaParser jp):
        call(* JavaParser.parse*(..))
        &amp;&amp; target(jp)
        &amp;&amp; !call(Stmt parseVarDec(boolean)); // var decs
                                              // are tricky

    around(JavaParser jp) returns ASTObject: parse(jp) {
        Token beginToken = jp.peekToken();
        ASTObject ret = proceed(jp);
        if (ret != null) jp.addContext(ret, beginToken);
        return ret;
     }
}
</pre><p>
        This example exhibits a property found in many aspects with large
        property-based pointcuts. In addition to a general property based
        pattern <tt>call(* JavaParser.parse*(..))</tt> it
        includes an exception to the pattern <tt>!call(Stmt
        parseVarDec(boolean))</tt>. The exclusion of
        <tt>parseVarDec</tt> happens because the parsing of
        variable declarations in Java is too complex to fit with the clean
        pattern of the other <tt>parse*</tt> methods. Even with
        the explicit exclusion this aspect is a clear expression of a clean
        crosscutting modularity. Namely that all
        <tt>parse*</tt> methods that return
        <tt>ASTObjects</tt>, except for
        <tt>parseVarDec</tt> share a common behavior for
        establishing the parse context of their result.
      </p><p>
        The process of writing an aspect with a large property-based
        pointcut, and of developing the appropriate exceptions can clarify
        the structure of the system. This is especially true, as in this
        case, when refactoring existing code to use aspects. When we first
        looked at the code for this aspect, we were able to use the IDE
        support provided in AJDE for JBuilder to see what methods the
        aspect was advising compared to our manual coding. We quickly
        discovered that there were a dozen places where the aspect advice
        was in effect but we had not manually inserted the required
        functionality. Two of these were bugs in our prior non-AOP
        implementation of the parser. The other ten were needless
        performance optimizations. So, here, refactoring the code to
        express the crosscutting structure of the aspect explicitly made
        the code more concise and eliminated latent bugs.
