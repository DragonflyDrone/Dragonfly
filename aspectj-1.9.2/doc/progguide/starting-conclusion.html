      AspectJ is a simple and practical aspect-oriented extension to
      Java. With just a few new constructs, AspectJ provides support for
      modular implementation of a range of crosscutting concerns.
    </p><p>
      Adoption of AspectJ into an existing Java development project can be
      a straightforward and incremental task. One path is to begin by using
      only development aspects, going on to using production aspects and
      then reusable aspects after building up experience with
      AspectJ. Adoption can follow other paths as well. For example, some
      developers will benefit from using production aspects right
      away. Others may be able to write clean reusable aspects almost right
      away.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ enables both name-based and property based crosscutting.
      Aspects that use name-based crosscutting tend to affect a small
      number of other classes. But despite their small scale, they can
      often eliminate significant complexity compared to an ordinary Java
      implementation.  Aspects that use property-based crosscutting can
      have small or large scale.
    </p><p>
      Using AspectJ results in clean well-modularized implementations of
      crosscutting concerns. When written as an AspectJ aspect the
      structure of a crosscutting concern is explicit and easy to
      understand. Aspects are also highly modular, making it possible to
      develop plug-and-play implementations of crosscutting
      functionality.
    </p><p>
      AspectJ provides more functionality than was covered by this short
      introduction. The next chapter, <a href="language.html">The AspectJ Language</a>,
      covers in detail more of the features of the AspectJ language. The
      following chapter, <a href="examples.html">Examples</a>, then presents some
      carefully chosen examples that show you how AspectJ might be used. We
      recommend that you read the next two chapters carefully before
      deciding to adopt AspectJ into a project.
