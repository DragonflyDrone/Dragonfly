      The next two sections present the use of aspects in increasingly
      sophisticated ways. Development aspects are easily removed from
      production builds. Production aspects are intended to be used in
      both development and in production, but tend to affect only a few
      classes.
    </p><p>
      This section presents examples of aspects that can be used during
      development of Java applications. These aspects facilitate debugging,
      testing and performance tuning work. The aspects define behavior that
      ranges from simple tracing, to profiling, to testing of internal
      consistency within the application. Using AspectJ makes it possible
      to cleanly modularize this kind of functionality, thereby making it
      possible to easily enable and disable the functionality when desired.
    </p><div class="sect2"><a name="tracing"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="tracing"></a>Tracing</h3></div></div><p>
        This first example shows how to increase the visibility of the
        internal workings of a program. It is a simple tracing aspect that
        prints a message at specified method calls. In our figure editor
        example, one such aspect might simply trace whenever points are
        drawn.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect SimpleTracing {
    pointcut tracedCall():
        call(void FigureElement.draw(GraphicsContext));

    before(): tracedCall() {
        System.out.println("Entering: " + thisJoinPoint);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        This code makes use of the <tt>thisJoinPoint</tt> special
        variable. Within all advice bodies this variable is bound to an
        object that describes the current join point. The effect of this
        code is to print a line like the following every time a figure
        element receives a <tt>draw</tt> method call:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
Entering: call(void FigureElement.draw(GraphicsContext))
</pre><p>
        To understand the benefit of coding this with AspectJ consider
        changing the set of method calls that are traced. With AspectJ,
        this just requires editing the definition of the
        <tt>tracedCalls</tt> pointcut and recompiling. The
        individual methods that are traced do not need to be edited.
      </p><p>
        When debugging, programmers often invest considerable effort in
        figuring out a good set of trace points to use when looking for a
        particular kind of problem. When debugging is complete or appears
        to be complete it is frustrating to have to lose that investment by
        deleting trace statements from the code. The alternative of just
        commenting them out makes the code look bad, and can cause trace
        statements for one kind of debugging to get confused with trace
        statements for another kind of debugging.
      </p><p>
        With AspectJ it is easy to both preserve the work of designing a
        good set of trace points and disable the tracing when it isn t
        being used. This is done by writing an aspect specifically for that
        tracing mode, and removing that aspect from the compilation when it
        is not needed.
      </p><p>
        This ability to concisely implement and reuse debugging
        configurations that have proven useful in the past is a direct
        result of AspectJ modularizing a crosscutting design element the
        set of methods that are appropriate to trace when looking for a
        given kind of information.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="profiling-and-logging"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="profiling-and-logging"></a>Profiling and Logging</h3></div></div><p>
        Our second example shows you how to do some very specific
        profiling. Although many sophisticated profiling tools are
        available, and these can gather a variety of information and
        display the results in useful ways, you may sometimes want to
        profile or log some very specific behavior. In these cases, it is
        often possible to write a simple aspect similar to the ones above
        to do the job.
      </p><p>
        For example, the following aspect counts the number of calls to the
        <tt>rotate</tt> method on a <tt>Line</tt>
        and the number of calls to the <tt>set*</tt> methods of
        a <tt>Point</tt> that happen within the control flow
        of those calls to <tt>rotate</tt>:
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect SetsInRotateCounting {
    int rotateCount = 0;
    int setCount = 0;

    before(): call(void Line.rotate(double)) {
        rotateCount++;
    }

    before(): call(void Point.set*(int))
              &amp;&amp; cflow(call(void Line.rotate(double))) {
        setCount++;
    }
}
</pre><p>
        In effect, this aspect allows the programmer to ask very specific
        questions like

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          How many times is the <tt>rotate</tt>
          method defined on <tt>Line</tt> objects called?
        </blockquote>

        and

        <blockquote class="blockquote">
          How many times are methods defined on
          <tt>Point</tt> objects whose name begins with
          "<tt>set</tt>" called in fulfilling those rotate
          calls?
        </blockquote>

        questions it may be difficult to express using standard
        profiling or logging tools.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="pre-and-post-conditions"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="pre-and-post-conditions"></a>Pre- and Post-Conditions</h3></div></div><p>
        Many programmers use the "Design by Contract" style popularized by
        Bertand Meyer in <i>Object-Oriented Software Construction,
        2/e</i>. In this style of programming, explicit
        pre-conditions test that callers of a method call it properly and
        explicit post-conditions test that methods properly do the work
        they are supposed to.
      </p><p>
        AspectJ makes it possible to implement pre- and post-condition
        testing in modular form. For example, this code
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect PointBoundsChecking {

    pointcut setX(int x):
        (call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int)) &amp;&amp; args(x, *))
        || (call(void Point.setX(int)) &amp;&amp; args(x));

    pointcut setY(int y):
        (call(void FigureElement.setXY(int, int)) &amp;&amp; args(*, y))
        || (call(void Point.setY(int)) &amp;&amp; args(y));

    before(int x): setX(x) {
        if ( x &lt; MIN_X || x &gt; MAX_X )
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("x is out of bounds.");
    }

    before(int y): setY(y) {
        if ( y &lt; MIN_Y || y &gt; MAX_Y )
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("y is out of bounds.");
    }
}
</pre><p>
        implements the bounds checking aspect of pre-condition testing for
        operations that move points. Notice that the
        <tt>setX</tt> pointcut refers to all the operations
        that can set a Point's <tt>x</tt> coordinate; this
        includes the <tt>setX</tt> method, as well as half of
        the <tt>setXY</tt> method. In this sense the
        <tt>setX</tt> pointcut can be seen as involving very
        fine-grained crosscutting &#8212; it names the the
        <tt>setX</tt> method and half of the
        <tt>setXY</tt> method.
      </p><p>
        Even though pre- and post-condition testing aspects can often be
        used only during testing, in some cases developers may wish to
        include them in the production build as well. Again, because
        AspectJ makes it possible to modularize these crosscutting concerns
        cleanly, it gives developers good control over this decision.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="contract-enforcement"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="contract-enforcement"></a>Contract Enforcement</h3></div></div><p>
        The property-based crosscutting mechanisms can be very useful in
        defining more sophisticated contract enforcement. One very powerful
        use of these mechanisms is to identify method calls that, in a
        correct program, should not exist. For example, the following
        aspect enforces the constraint that only the well-known factory
        methods can add an element to the registry of figure
        elements. Enforcing this constraint ensures that no figure element
        is added to the registry more than once.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect RegistrationProtection {

    pointcut register(): call(void Registry.register(FigureElement));

    pointcut canRegister(): withincode(static * FigureElement.make*(..));

    before(): register() &amp;&amp; !canRegister() {
        throw new IllegalAccessException("Illegal call " + thisJoinPoint);
    }
}
</pre><p>
        This aspect uses the withincode primitive pointcut to denote all
        join points that occur within the body of the factory methods on
        <tt>FigureElement</tt> (the methods with names that
        begin with "<tt>make</tt>"). This is a property-based
        pointcut because it identifies join points based not on their
        signature, but rather on the property that they occur specifically
        within the code of another method. The before advice declaration
        effectively says signal an error for any calls to register that are
        not within the factory methods.
      </p><p>
        This advice throws a runtime exception at certain join points, but
        AspectJ can do better.  Using the <tt>declare error</tt>
        form, we can have the <span class="emphasis"><i>compiler</i></span> signal the
        error.
      </p><pre class="programlisting">
aspect RegistrationProtection {

    pointcut register(): call(void Registry.register(FigureElement));
    pointcut canRegister(): withincode(static * FigureElement.make*(..));

    declare error: register() &amp;&amp; !canRegister(): "Illegal call"
}
</pre><p>
        When using this aspect, it is impossible for the compiler to
        compile programs with these illegal calls.  This early detection is
        not always possible.  In this case, since we depend only on static
        information (the <tt>withincode</tt> pointcut picks out
        join points totally based on their code, and the
        <tt>call</tt> pointcut here picks out join points
        statically).  Other enforcement, such as the precondition
        enforcement, above, does require dynamic information such as the
        runtime value of parameters.
      </p></div><div class="sect2"><a name="configuration-management"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="configuration-management"></a>Configuration Management</h3></div></div><p>
        Configuration management for aspects can be handled using a variety
        of make-file like techniques. To work with optional aspects, the
        programmer can simply define their make files to either include the
        aspect in the call to the AspectJ compiler or not, as desired.
      </p><p>
        Developers who want to be certain that no aspects are included in
        the production build can do so by configuring their make files so
        that they use a traditional Java compiler for production builds. To
        make it easy to write such make files, the AspectJ compiler has a
        command-line interface that is consistent with ordinary Java
        compilers.
